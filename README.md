# Code_Challenges
Technical interview code challenge practice

Getting ready for technical questions in interviews.

Goals:

1. Code everyday
2. Practice OOP in python
3. Prep for interviews to feel more confident
4. Research and gain a better understanding of concepts I should know

Will be adding files for each challenge, files will contain notebooks for each code challenge along with research on the topics.

Will be adding examples here soon.
